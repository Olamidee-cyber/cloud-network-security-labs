#  Cloud Fortress EC2 Lab

This lab launches a secure EC2 web server in a public subnet, installs Apache, sets up a custom HTML message, and verifies access via the public IP.

##  What I did
- Created a VPC with subnets and security groups
- Launched an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux
- Installed Apache (httpd)
- Echoed a custom message into `/var/www/html/index.html`
- Verified public access via IPv4

##  Public IP Access Example
`http://35.183.78.57` (your actual IP here)

## Screenshots
- Add terminal screenshot of EC2 access
- Add browser screenshot of web page response
