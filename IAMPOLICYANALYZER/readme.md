# IAM Guardian 

**A Python + Boto3 CLI tool to detect over-permissive IAM policies in AWS.**

This script scans all IAM users and checks for attached policies (both managed and inline) that include dangerous wildcards like `Action: *` or `Resource: *`. It flags these policies to help enforce least-privilege access â€” a core AWS security principle.
